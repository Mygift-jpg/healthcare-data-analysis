# Healthcare Data Analysis Project

## 📊 Project Overview
Analysis of 1,000 hospital patient records to identify cost drivers, admission patterns, and operational trends that inform resource allocation and staffing decisions.

## 🎯 Business Questions Answered
1. **Which medical conditions generate the highest costs?**
   - Analyzed both total revenue and average cost per patient
   - Identified top 3 cost drivers for hospital budget planning

2. **What are the monthly admission trends?**
   - Tracked patient volume across 12 months
   - Identified peak and low periods for staffing optimization

3. **How do treatment costs vary by patient demographics?**
   - Compared billing patterns across gender and age groups
   - Provided insights for equitable care delivery

4. **Which treatments require the longest hospital stays?**
   - Calculated average length of stay by treatment type
   - Supported bed capacity and resource planning

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python 3.x** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **Pandas** - Data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation
- **SQL (SQLite)** - Database querying and data extraction
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - Data visualization
- **Google Colab** - Development environment

## 🔍 Key Findings
- **Cost Analysis:** Cancer accounts for 35% of total hospital revenue despite representing only 18% of patients
- **Operational Trends:** Patient admissions peak in September, 2021, requiring 25% additional staffing capacity
- **Treatment Efficiency:** Physical Therapy has the shortest average stay (3.2 days) vs Surgery (8.7 days)
- **Demographic Insights:** No significant cost disparity between patient demographics, indicating equitable care
